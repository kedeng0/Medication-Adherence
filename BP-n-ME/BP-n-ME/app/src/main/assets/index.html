              <h3 class="HeadingSecT">Why are you doing this research study?</h3>
              <p class="PrtStyle">
                  This study is being conducted by Drs. Alyssa Elrod, Pamela Moye, Teresa Pounds, Kevin Murnane, Paul Douglass, and Ngozika Orjioke (the researchers from here on referred to as “we”). We want to learn more about if we can use the information participants provide in a mobile application, known as BP-n-Me, and if follow-up phone calls help people who have heart failure (HF) and/or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This study will help us learn more about why people with your condition(s) sometimes go back to the hospital soon after being sent home. We are asking people like you who have HF and/or COPD to help us.
              </p>

              <h3 class="HeadingSecT">What happens if I say yes, I want to be in the study?</h3>

              <p class="PrtStyle">
                  If you say yes and sign this document, we will:
              </p>
              <ul class="LeftMrgn">
                  <li>Ask about your personal information (age, gender, race, marital status, insurance status, medical conditions, education), lifestyle habits, if you have a cell phone with data capabilities that does or does not have near field communication (NFC) technology currently with you in the hospital, and what is a current and active phone number to reach you at. </li>
                  <li>There are no right or wrong answers to these questions. You can skip any question you do not want to answer.</li>
                  <li>Assign you to Group A (intervention group) or Group B (control group) for this study. Your answers about your cell phone may impact which group we can place you in. Your doctor will still manage your disease accordingly regardless of which group you are in.</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="PrtStyle">
                  For those placed in Group A:<br>

                  <li>Will ask you about demographic factors, your lifestyle habits, symptoms, blood pressure, heart rate, weight, what medications you take, contact information for your primary care doctor, contact information for your outpatient pharmacy, contact information for you, and survey responses. There are no right or wrong answers to these questions. You can skip any question you do not want to answer.</li>
                  <li>May call you after you leave the hospital on days 1 through 30 after you have been discharged from WellStar Atlanta Medical Center from the admission when you were asked about and agreed to be in this study to ask questions related to the information you provide us in the mobile application. We will also call you 30 days after you have been discharged to ask if you have been back to the hospital and if so, where you went and why you went back. </li>
                  <li>If we are unable to reach you at the time we call, we will make one additional attempt to call you that day or the next day. We will not leave a message on your device that reveals specific information about your health. </li>
                  <li>You are not required to provide an additional or back-up phone number. However, if you would like to provide us with another phone number we may contact you at and we reach someone you know, you understand that we will state the following to them: “Hello, my name is researcher’s name, I am calling from WellStar Atlanta Medical Center and am trying to reach your name. Is your name available or can you ask him/her to call me back at phone number researcher calling from. Thank you.” We will not reveal specific information about your health. </li>
              </ul>
              <p class="PrtStyle">
                  You, the participant,
              </p>
              <ul>
                  <li>Will download the BP-n-Me mobile application to your cell phone and use your cellular data or WiFi to use the application.</li>
                  <li>Will update the researchers if additional medication changes are made by your doctor after you are discharged so that we can update your medication list in the app.</li>
                  <li>Will be able to record your blood pressure and heart rate in the application for your information only. </li>
                  <li>Will be asked to record your weight, when you take your medications, and your symptoms daily. </li>
                  <li>May receive push notifications on your phone from the application throughout the study.</li>
                  <li>Will receive a push notification from the application on day 28 thanking you for your participation in the study and asking you to complete satisfaction and medication surveys.</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="PrtStyle">
                  For those placed in Group B:<br>

              <ul>

              </p>

                  <li>Will be asked about demographic factors and your lifestyle habits. </li>
              </ul>

              <h3 class="HeadingSecT">How long will the study take?</h3>
              <ul>
                  <li>If you say yes, the first visit to get everything set-up may take about 30 minutes. If you receive a phone call from one of the researchers or a trained study professional, it should only take about 10-15 minutes of your time for each conversation. </li>
                  <li>For Group A, we will be actively reviewing the information provided in the mobile application once daily until 30 days after you are discharged from WellStar Atlanta Medical Center from the admission when you were asked about and agreed to be in this study. We will not be reviewing the information you provide in the mobile application in real-time and after day 30 following your discharge, we will no longer be actively reviewing the information you provide in the mobile application other than your survey responses. We will also call you 30 days after you have been discharged from WellStar Atlanta Medical Center from the admission when you were asked about and agreed to be in this study. We will ask if you have been back to the hospital and if so, where you went and why you went back.</li>
                  <li>For Group B, we will call you 30 days after you have been discharged from WellStar Atlanta Medical Center from the admission when you were asked about and agreed to be in this study. We will ask if you have been back to the hospital and if so, where you went and why you went back.  </li>
              </ul>

              <h3 class="HeadingSecT">What information will you use and share for the study?</h3>
              <p class="PrtStyle">
                  If you say yes and provide authorization by signing this document, we will also:
              </p>
              <ul>
                  <li>Use and share information from Wellstar Atlanta Medical Center.</li>
                  <li>Use and share information from your entire medical record, your past medical history and diagnoses, your medical record number, your date of birth, what medicines you take, the results of lab tests, and information collected during the possible phone calls with the researchers or trained study professionals for research purposes only.</li>
                  <li>We may ask you for or look at information provided to WellStar Atlanta Medical Center regarding if you have to go back to the hospital again within 30-days of when you leave WellStar Atlanta Medical Center. </li>
                  <li>For group A participants only, we will use and share information from your use of and the information you put into the mobile application, BP-n-Me.</li>
                  <li>The information we are asking to use and share is called “Protected Health Information.” It is protected by a federal law called the Privacy Rule of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). In general, we cannot use or share your health information for research without your permission. </li>
                  <li>If you want, we can give you more information about the Privacy Rule. Also, if you have any questions about the Privacy Rule you can speak to the IRB Chair, Dr. David Anders, at (404) 265 -3592.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3 class="HeadingSecT">How will you use and share my information?</h3>
              <ul>
                  <li>We will use your information only for the study described in this document.</li>
                  <li>We will do our best to protect your information by using it as allowed in this document and as directed by state and federal law. But, if we share information with people who do not have to follow the Privacy Rule, your information will no longer be protected by the Privacy Rule. Let us know if you have questions about this.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3 class="HeadingSecT">What happens if I say no?</h3>
              <p class="PrtStyle">
                  If you say no:
              </p>

                  <li>While you would not be a part of the program in this study, you will not lose any other benefits.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3 class="HeadingSecT">What happens if I say yes, but change my mind later?</h3>
              <p class="PrtStyle">
                  You can stop being in the study at any time. You will not be penalized.  While you would not be a part of the program in this study, you will not lose any other benefits. You can tell us to stop using and sharing health information that can be traced to you. We will stop, except in very limited cases, if needed to comply with law, protect your safety, or make sure the research was done properly. If you have any questions about this please ask. If you stop this study, your doctor will still manage your disease accordingly.<br>
                  If you have any questions contact, Alyssa Elrod at (404)-265-3698 or alyssa.elrod@wellstar.org.
              </p>

              <h3 class="HeadingSecT">Who will see my answers?</h3>
              <p class="PrtStyle">
                  The only people allowed to see your answers will be the people who work on the study and people who make sure we run our study the right way.<br>
                  Your survey answers, health information, and a copy of this document will be locked in our files. The information you provide in the mobile application will be stored on a secure server and you will be assigned a special number to decrease the chance of someone linking your information back to you. <br>
                  We will not put your answers into your medical record, but we will put that you are participating in a research study in your medical record. We may publish and share the results of the study in medical and/or pharmacy journals. This means that we can write about your answers and other people can read what we write, but your answers will only be written about on a group basis. This means we will not include your name and that there should not be a way for someone to tell which answers belonged to you. We will do our best to make sure no one outside the study will know you are a part of the study.
              </p>

              <h3 class="HeadingSecT">Will it cost me anything to be in the study?</h3>
              <p class="PrtStyle">
                  Cost to you are expected to be none to minimal. For participants in Group A, the use of the BP-n-Me mobile application will require very minimal data from WiFi or your mobile data plan. A lot of use of the application should not use more than a few megabytes of data per month.
              </p>

              <h3 class="HeadingSecT">Will being in this study help me in any way?</h3>
              <p class="PrtStyle">
                  There might be some scientific benefit from this study. Being in the study will possibly help you understand your HF and/or COPD better. For participants in Group A, you will be able to continue to use the BP-n-Me mobile application for free after the study as a thank you for your participation until the application is no longer available at the discretion of the researchers or no longer works on your device due to device updates. Again, we will not be monitoring the information you put into the application after 30 days after your discharge from WellStar Atlanta Medical Center when you were asked to be in this study with the exception of your satisfaction and medication survey responses.
              </p>

              <h3 class="HeadingSecT">Will I be paid for my time?</h3>
              <p class="PrtStyle">
                  No. This study does involve the use of a mobile application that may have a commercial impact in the future. You will not be compensated for your participation in this study or for your use of this mobile application.
              </p>

              <h3 class="HeadingSecT">Is there any way being in this study could be bad for me?</h3>
              <p class="PrtStyle">
                  Yes. There is a chance that: </p>
              <ul>
                  <li>The questions could make you sad or upset.</li>
                  <li>Even though we will do our best to protect your information, someone could find out that you were in the study and learn something about you that you did not want them to know.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3 class="HeadingSecT">How long will my health information be used?</h3>
              <p class="PrtStyle">
                  We expect the entirety of our study to take 1 year. For Group A participants, we will be actively reviewing the information provided in the mobile application once daily on days 1 through 30 after you are discharged from WellStar Atlanta Medical Center from the admission when you were asked about and agreed to be in this study. Again, we will not be monitoring the information you put into the application after 30 days after your discharge from WellStar Atlanta Medical Center when you were asked to be in this study with the exception of your satisfaction and medication survey responses. For Group B participants, we will call you 30 days after you have been discharged from WellStar Atlanta Medical Center from admission when you were asked about and agreed to be in this study. We reserve the right to look back at the information we collected from you and about you during your 30 days after discharge throughout the entirety of study for research purposes only.
              </p>
