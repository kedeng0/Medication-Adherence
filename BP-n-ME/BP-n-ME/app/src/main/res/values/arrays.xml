        <item index="7">A low salt diet can lower your blood pressure and reduce the risk of your body holding on to too much fluid which can cause swelling of the legs or feet and other health problems. Salt, also known as sodium, is in many of the frozen, boxed, bagged, and canned foods available in the grocery store as well as table salt. A common goal for a low sodium diet is eating less than 2,000 milligrams (mgs) per day which is about one teaspoon of table salt.  Low sodium foods should have 140 mgs or less of sodium per serving. Review the food labels on your food to make your choice of which foods you should eat. Please contact your healthcare practitioner or pharmacist if you would like to learn more about low salt diets. </item>
